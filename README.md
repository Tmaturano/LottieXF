# LottieXF

LottieXF is a simple demonstration of Lottie in a Xamarin Forms App.

* Lottie is a library created by the developers of Airbnb. You can read more about Lottie here (https://airbnb.design/introducing-lottie/).

* The animations can be downloaded throughout this link (https://www.lottiefiles.com/ ) or you can create your own based in a conversion from a After Effects file to a JSON file.

* For more information about how to install the nuget package and initialize lottie in Xamarin Forms, check the blog from Gerald Versluis here (https://blog.verslu.is/xamarin/xamarin-forms-xamarin/xamarin-app-lottie-animations/)
